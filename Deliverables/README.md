# Testing deliverable
Deliverable code to increase test coverage over:
- [x] ./src/pages/members/list/mappers
- [x] ./src/pages/members/list/actions
- [x] ./src/pages/members/list/reducers
- [x] ./src/pages/members/list/components
- [x] ./src/pages/members/list/pageContainer

Bonus points:
- [x] Create reselect state functions for Login page and cover them following TDD.
- [x] Create pull request policy to avoid merge branches if coverage is not fullfiled (% TBD).
- [x] Use Travis CI linked to a repository to show policies.
